# hello-world
A new repository for a new creator
My name is Gabriel, i from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and at the moment i'm living in Campo Grande - Mato Grosso do Sul
I came here to study in the federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul.
I'm a guy who likes to be on the outside, feel the sun and the wind blowing over my face.
I'm totally new at programming, so, for now i'm very, very curious in all about this world that i'm diving in.
